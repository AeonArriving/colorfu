## Why is it

Writing the word Fu is the tradition of Chinese New Year, people will write a big Fu on red paper and stick it on the door to express the good expectations of the new year.

What it if you can use more colors and more words to express more? Not only can you make your wallpapers beautiful, but also make them meaningful.
